# Creational Design Patterns

## What are Creational Design Patterns?

Creational Design Patterns are solutions to common problems that revolve around the concept of creating objects.
These patterns are focused on creating objects in an abstract manner.
Using Creational design patterns allows the program to be independent of how and what objects are created.

## Two Types of Creational Design Patterns

There are two types of Creational Design Patterns: Class and Object.
Class creational design patterns focus on using inheritance to vary the class that is instantiated.
Object creational design patterns delegate the instantiation to another object.

## Two Main Themes

There are two main themes that all creational patterns follow:

1. Encapsulate information about which concrete classes the system is using.

2. Hide how the instances of these classes are being created and composed together.

The only way the user and the rest of the system will be able to interact with the objects created is through their interfaces and abstract classes.


Within this directory, there are a couple of Gradle projects of some of the most popular Creational Design Patterns. These patterns include but are not limited to the Abstract Factory, and Singleton Design Patterns.
