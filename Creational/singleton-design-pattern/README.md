# Singleton Design Pattern
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern
The singleton design pattern is used to restrict the instantiation of a class to only one object that can be accessed from a well-known access point.
This functionality can be implemented by declaring all constructors of the class to be private and by giving the class a static method that returns a reference to the instance.
