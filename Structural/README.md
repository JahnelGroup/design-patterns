# Structural Design Patterns
This directory is dedicated to Structural design patterns.
These patterns revolve around how classes and objects are composed to make larger structures.
There are two types of Structural design patterns: Structural class, and Structural object patterns. Structural class patterns use inheritance in order to compose implementations or interfaces. Structural object patterns focus more on ways to compose objects to come up with new functionality.
