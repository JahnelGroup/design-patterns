# Structural Design Patterns

## What are Structural Design Patterns?

Structural Design Patterns are solutions to common problems that revolve around the concept of making relationships between entities.

## Two Types of Structural Design Patterns

There are two types of Structural design patterns: Structural class, and Structural object patterns.
Structural class patterns use inheritance in order to compose implementations or interfaces.
These type of patterns are useful when you want to make independently created class libraries work together.
Structural object patterns focus more on ways to compose objects to come up with new functionality. These type of patterns allows more flexibility when managing the relationship between entities because of the ability to change the composition at run-time.

Within this directory, there are a couple of Gradle projects of some of the most popular Structural Design Patterns. These patterns include but are not limited to the Adapter, and Facade design patterns.
